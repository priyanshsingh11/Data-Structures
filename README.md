# 📘 DSA Practice – LeetCode / GFG / CodeForces

This repository contains my daily solutions to **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems from platforms like **LeetCode**, **GeeksforGeeks**, and **CodeForces**.  
I maintain this repo to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and build a solid foundation in algorithms.

## 🚀 What’s Inside?

- 🔹 **Clean and optimized solutions**  
- 🔹 **Python / C++ implementations** (depending on the problem)  
- 🔹 **Structured folders by topic**  
- 🔹 **Daily updates** as I solve new questions  
- 🔹 **Simple explanations** inside each file  

---Each folder may contain:
- `problem_name.py` or `problem_name.cpp`  
- `explanation.md` (optional)
