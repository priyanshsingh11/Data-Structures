📘 DSA Practice – LeetCode / GFG Solutions / CodeForces

This repository contains my daily solutions to Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) problems from platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.
I maintain this repo to track my progress, improve problem-solving skills, and build a strong foundation in algorithms.

🚀 What’s Inside?

🔹 Clean and optimized solutions

🔹 Python / CPP solutions (depending on the problem)

🔹 Structured folders based on topics

🔹 Daily updates as I solve new questions

🔹 Simple explanations inside each file

📂 Folder Structure (Example)
/Arrays
/Strings
/TwoPointers
